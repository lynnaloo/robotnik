Robotnik is an open-source robotics programming shell for education built on [JohnnyFive](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) and [Google Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/). By dragging and assembling blocks together in the right sequence, you can make your robot do cool things and switch to a source code view for more advanced hacking!

This was developed for a workshop for Makerland Conference. If I was smarter, I would have probably used [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/), but how could I turn down the opportunity to write an awesome new piece of software?
